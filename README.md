# CorelDB Feature Extraction and Classification

This project was developed to extract features from the Corel Image Database (CorelDB) and classify the images using machine learning techniques. The purpose of this project is to implement a feature extraction and classification system using various feature descriptors and classifiers.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/corelDB-feature-extraction-and-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd corelDB-feature-extraction-and-classification
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. 

## Usage
To use the CorelDB feature extraction and classification system, follow these instructions:

1. Prepare your dataset by placing the CorelDB images in the appropriate directories as specified in the project.
2. For the statistical analysis part, use the `statistical_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
3. Fot the image classification task, use the `proiect-cppsms.ipynb` notebook.
